# Vulkan Point-to-Point Rocket Simulator
![rocket gameplay](https://github.com/SimoneReale/Computer-Graphics-2021-22/assets/62029302/93e04dbc-4646-43fe-a6cb-58cbacb5aa39)
The Vulkan Rocket Simulator reproduces point-to-point missile trajectories using the
Vulkan API for graphics rendering. This simulation tool is unique in that it relies
solely on the Vulkan API for graphics and does not require any external libraries. It
provides a highly customizable and realistic experience by allowing users to control
various parameters, including velocity, angle of departure, and wind power, to model
different launch conditions accurately. All physics calculations are handled within the
program, ensuring accurate modeling of rocket trajectories and their interactions with
environmental factors.
